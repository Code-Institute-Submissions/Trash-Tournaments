## Testing

### Code validators

I used [w3.org's validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for my HTML validation checks.

+ The only warning received across all pages was about using h1 as a top level element only.
    + The warning was ignored as they were design decisions.

I used [w3.org's validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for my CSS validation checks.

CSS (style.css)

+ No errors were found within the document.

### Responsiveness

To test the responsiveness of the site I used [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/).

Notes:

+ Through the use of vertical width in my font sizes and containers the site is responsive on all screen sizes I've tested personally. There may be slight issues on certain abstract displays; cinema screens etc that might need additional media queries as I experienced minor issues in the development of the project pertaining to content being too big for the viewport.

### Browser Compatibility

I tested the appearance and responsiveness of the website across 5 different browsers and varying browser sizes and these are my results.

|    All Pages   | Firefox | Chrome |  IE  | Edge | Opera |
|:--------------:|:-------:|:------:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|
| Appearance     |   Good  |  Good  | Good | Good |  Good |
| Responsiveness |   Good  |  Good  | Good | Good |  Good |

Notes:

+ Everything functions as expected and no issues that I could find.

### Bugs

+ The first bug I encountered was my background image not showing up when I pushed the code to github pages.
    + This was due to a faulty file path where I had a / which caused it to look for the image at the root of the current web rather than the current folder.
